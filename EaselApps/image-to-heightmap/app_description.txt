Import an image and use the settings to generate a height map of your image. Max Height / Width - Resizes output to fit within these bounds. Resolution - Granularity of the resultant shape. Smaller values = more detail. Layers = 1 to 255 layers possible. Each layer is comprised of all the pixels that fall within that color range. (High number of layers will likely crash your EASEL session. Use with caution.)

(All images are resized down to 1024 pixels max within the app.)
